This is not just another word search game... it’s a *romantic mission*! 🕵️‍♀️❤️

In this Angular-powered game, your special someone will need to find **three hidden words**:
```
ACEITA  
NAMORAR  
COMIGO
```

Once they find them all, they’ll be met with two choices:
- ✅ **SIM** — which will lead to love and happily ever after.  
- ❌ **NÃO** — *but good luck trying to click it!* 😜 (spoiler: it runs away 🏃‍♀️💨)
